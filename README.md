# 📊 IB Extended Essay – Linear Regression Analysis on Student Performance

> Status: Completed (as part of my IB Extended Essay)

## 📌 Description

This project was developed for my **IB Extended Essay**, where I explored the relationship between various student habits and their academic performance using **linear and multiple linear regression models** in Python.

## 🧠 Research Question

**To what extent can behavioral factors such as sleep, attendance, study hours, and social media usage predict student academic performance?**

## 📁 Dataset

- Dataset used: **Student Performance and Learning Styles** from Kaggle  
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/student-performance-and-learning-style/data

## 🧪 Methods Used

- Simple Linear Regression  
- Multiple Linear Regression  
- Pearson Correlation Coefficient  
- Data visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing with `pandas`

## 📉 Summary of Findings

Unfortunately, the analysis showed **very weak or no correlation** between the selected lifestyle factors and students’ final grades. Even the multi-variable model produced **low predictive power**. (I think this is due to the fact that the dataset used is synthetic so it should not be taken seriously)
However, the project helped me:

- Learn and implement machine learning algorithms in Python  
- Work with real-world data  
- Understand statistical modeling and interpretation of weak results

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn

## 📚 Academic Context

This analysis was submitted as part of the **IB Extended Essay**, and reflects both the **strengths and limitations** of data-based research in education-related topics.
